# XW: fill generalized crossword grids

Given a generalized grid and a word list,
XW finds all the ways the grid can be filled with words from the list.

Generalized grids include:

* Conventional 2D grids (black-square, barrier style, etc.)
* Grids on tori or Klein bottles
* 'Split Decisions' puzzles,
occasionally featured in the NYT Sunday Magazine,
where pairs of slots share leading and trailing letters.
* Other planar and non-planar forms.

* [Implementation notes](https://github.com/davidpanderson/xw/wiki/Implementation-notes)
